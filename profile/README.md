# Scint

Scint is a framework designed for building modular intelligent assistants using GPT-4. It excels in providing a vast array of functionalities through specialized workers, demonstrating the robust capabilities of distributed AI systems in managing complex tasks with unparalleled efficiency.

## Structured, Composable Intelligence

At the heart of Scint's philosophy is the creation of intelligent worker modules. These modules are engineered to boost user productivity and automate tasks in various domains. Unlike traditional frameworks that are often limited in scope, Scint bridges the gap:

- Chat-based Assistants: Typically centered around human operators, these assistants possess toolchains for web access and data retrieval but face inherent functional limitations.
- Autonomous Agents: Positioned at the other end of the spectrum, these AI applications autonomously evaluate and execute tasks. Despite their potential, they often yield suboptimal results without consistent human oversight.

Scint strikes a balance by acknowledging the limitations of LLMs (Large Language Models) and harnessing their strengths. It positions the human operator at the forefront, supplemented by composable, agent-like toolchains adept at solving real-world problems and enhancing productivity.

Scint empowers developers and organizations to construct and coordinate intelligence in a modular manner, allowing the creation of customized intelligent applications through the integration of diverse capabilities.

## How Scint Works

> Note: Scint is still in the early stages of development

While Scint functions as a typical AI-powered chatbot for standard interactions, it is cognizant of its extended capabilities. When needed, it can delegate tasks and establish pipelines for efficient execution. Key modules in Scint include:

- Persona: The user-facing module of Scint, the Persona is designed to streamline user interactions and maintain a consistent AI personality. It understands Scint's capabilities and knows when to engage with the Coordinator.
- Coordinator: This module orchestrates the tasks relayed by the Persona. It comprehends each Worker's role but not the specifics of their operation.
- Worker: Workers are the backbone of Scintâ€™s functionality, each tasked with specific roles. They work in a relay-like manner, passing context and progressively working towards completing complex tasks.
